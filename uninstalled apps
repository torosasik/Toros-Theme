I want to find out if there is any leftover code in my theme or site files from any of the apps in the list below (these apps are uninstalled).

Instructions:

Do not change anything yet!

Search all theme and code files for any code, scripts, assets, snippets, or references related to the apps listed below.

If you are mostly sure that a piece of code is from one of these uninstalled apps, report it.

If you are unsure, or if the code might be from a different app with similar features that is still installed, skip it for now.

For each app where you find leftover code, tell me:

The name of the app

Which file(s) the code appears in

A short code example or line as proof

Wait for my confirmation before deleting anything!
